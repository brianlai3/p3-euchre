EECS 280 Project 3: Euchre
===========================
Euchre (pronounced “YOO-kur”) is a card game popular in Michigan.

The learning goals of this project include Abstract Data Types in C++, Derived Classes, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. You’ll gain practice with C++-style Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes and virtual functions.

When you’re done, you’ll have a program that simulates a game of Euchre, supporting a AI player and a Human player.
